/* 
Mr Roberts the mad Maths teacher, has really lost the plot! 

He's got bored of regular maths teaching and now refuses to use any numbers unless they are prime.

Your job is to check all of his textbooks (tests made up of arrays of positive integers only) and remove all the non-prime numbers (return arrays made up only of prime numbers).

*Reminder - a prime number is a number that can be divided only by itself and 1.*

e.g. turn [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] into [2,3,5,7]

Good luck!
